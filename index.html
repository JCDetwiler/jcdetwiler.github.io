  <ul style="font-size: 16px;">
    <li>
      <h5>Languages</h5>
      <p>
        I love studying foreign languages. I studied German for 5 years in
        middle and high school. I then started learning Japanese and Mandarin
        Chinese in my undergrad. I've spent the most time learning Japanese
        (mostly through music) and these days I'm working to improve my Chinese again.
      </p>

    <li>
      <h5>Music</h5>
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a>
        has become my favorite "genre" over the past several years, though I
        love listening to nearly everything. My favorite actual genres fall into
        rock and metal; I started learning how to play guitar in 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        I especially enjoy following how machine learning is starting to leave a
        footprint in the music industry. This deep learning based
        synthesization of
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqX_cyF7bpM">How Far I'll Go</a> from Moana is remarkable.
      </p>

    <li>
      <h5>Reading</h5>
      <p>
        I enjoy reading when I have time.
        You can find me and the books I've liked on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/jdetwiler">Goodreads</a>.
        I also really enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">WEBTOON</a>
        and I subscribe to over 30 comics there, my favorite being
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95&page=1">Tower of God</a>.
