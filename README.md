This repository hosts [my personal website][1].

It's a Jekyll-based site with Bootstrap and Font Awesome, hosted by GitHub
Pages.

Thanks to [this site][6] for the free background image, and to labmates
[Tyler][3] and [Ayaan][4] for design inspirations.

Reuse of design components is completely welcome. Just don't take the content,
of course.
