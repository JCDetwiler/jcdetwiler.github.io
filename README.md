This repository hosts [my personal website][1].

It's a Jekyll-based site with Bootstrap and Font Awesome, hosted by GitHub
Pages. My design has both old-school (e.g. the background) and modern components
that I intentionally tried to blend together.

Thanks to [Dr. Vogel][2] for the background image, and to labmates
[Tyler Chang][3] and [Ayaan Kazerouni][4] for design inspirations.

Reuse of design components is completely welcome. Just don't take the content,
of course.
